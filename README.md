Hi, I'm Redwanul Abedin but feel free to call me Red.
I'm an aspiring developper with the aim of working in the devops world later on.
I've got no formal education in computer science or the like, but I'm a fast learner and love tinkering with code.

Current goals:
  - Learn basic python
  - Learn basic rust
  - Learn proper git usage and practices
  
Later goals:
  - Develop unity games
  - Learn java
  - Learn javascript
  - Learn C#
  - Learn C++
  - Learn Node.js
  - Learn React
  - Learn more about DevOps
  
Outside of software development, I also mainly run linux and love to tinker with it. I'll likely be uploading some of my linux stuff on here as well.
If you made it this far, thanks for reading!
