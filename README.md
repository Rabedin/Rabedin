Hi, I'm Redwanul Abedin but feel free to call me Red.
I'm an aspiring developper still trying to figure out where I want to go.
I've got no formal education in computer science or the like, so I fuck around and find out.

Current goals:
  - Get more comfortable with nix
  - Learn some python
  - Do nasty things with a microcontroller
  
Later goals:
  - Learn some rust
  - Figure out what I want to dev
  
Outside of software development, I also mainly run linux and love to tinker with it. I'll likely be uploading some of my linux stuff on here as well.
If you made it this far, thanks for reading!
