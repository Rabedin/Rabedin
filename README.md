Hi, I'm Redwanul Abedin but feel free to call me Red.
I'm an aspiring developper looking still trying to figure out where I want to go.
I've got no formal education in computer science or the like, but I'm a fast learner and love tinkering.

Current goals:
  - Learn basic python
  - Learn basic rust
  - Learn proper git usage and practices
  - Get more comfortable with nix
  
Later goals:
  - Develop games
  - Learn javascript
  - Find a js framework that works for me and learn it
  - Learn C#
  - Learn C++
  - Learn more about DevOps
  
Outside of software development, I also mainly run linux and love to tinker with it. I'll likely be uploading some of my linux stuff on here as well.
If you made it this far, thanks for reading!
